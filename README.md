# matrix

a small project im working on solely to avoid having to do my linear algebra homework! the goal is to eventually be able to input a matrix representing a linear system of equations into the program, and the program will reduce the matrix to either row echelon form OR reduced row echelon form. 

currently a wip, and the code is a mess, but i'll be cleaning the code up and adding some style in the near future.

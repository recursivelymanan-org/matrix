# matrix

a small project im working on solely to avoid having to do my linear algebra homework! the goal is to eventually be able to input a matrix representing a linear system of equations into the program, and the program will reduce the matrix to either row echelon form (REF) OR reduced row echelon form (RREF).

~~currently a work in progress, and the code is a mess, but i'll be cleaning the code up and adding some style in the near future.~~
code is now not a *complete* mess  

**NOTE:** known issue with numbers that cannot be represented by decimals ( 1/3 , 2/3 , etc)

## progress notes
4/6/21 : REF transformation now functional  
4/7/21 : separated project into multiple files, changed functions to be nonstatic  
4/8/21 : ReducedREF transformation now functional, program is completely working through terminal!

## plans
eventually want to use React to turn this whole thing into a web app :)
